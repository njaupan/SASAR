# SASAR
Meta-assembly tool using pseudomolecules-like “super-assembly” from assembly reconciliation
Different assemblier has different advatanges, it was difficult to evaluate what was the best assembly for each dataset.
and we could not polish all our 22 assemblies of one species with Illumina data to reduce base error, 
as it would be time consuming and would use large computational power.
The “best” assembly with all desired features such as including complete centromeric regions 
or most complete single-copy orthologs usually is not obtained from a single assembler.
